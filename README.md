## 1. Presentation

Imagine being a space engineer for just one minute. Sixty seconds to build a home in the stars. Sounds impossible? That’s exactly the challenge of this game.  

It is a single-player adventure where the clock is ticking, your imagination is alive, and every decision matters. From placing the airlock in the right spot to choosing where your astronauts will sleep, you’re not just building a habitat; you’re creating a tiny universe where people can live, work, and explore.

You start by picking your habitat. Perhaps the classic cylindrical module draws you in, solid and dependable, reminiscent of the International Space Station. Or maybe the hybrid “canister” habitat catches your eye, with its rigid base and inflatable upper floors, perfect for lunar or Martian surfaces. For those seeking a futuristic challenge, the expandable capsule packs a large living space into a compact launch configuration. Each choice is more than a design decision—it is a personality statement.

Once you have selected your stage, the real fun begins. Players are provided with a suite of items inspired by real space technologies: airlocks, exercise machines, research labs, and more. You drag, drop, and arrange each system, striving to make everything fit, work, and make sense. As the timer ticks down, you may find the medical station still missing—chaotic, yet rewarding, as the game balances strategy with playful improvisation.

The countdown drives the thrill, producing tension and excitement while allowing experimentation and discovery. Every session is a small story of triumph, failure, and the minor victories in between.

Stellar Legacy teaches without lecturing. Astronauts require exercise, sleep, and proper nutrition. The airlock is essential for extravehicular activities. Life support systems are critical. Every decision carries consequences, each serving as a mini-lesson wrapped in engaging gameplay.

Being single-player allows a focus on creativity without external pressure. You may plan meticulously or experiment wildly; both approaches are valid. Every habitat you design tells a story, from compact efficiency in a small capsule to sprawling layouts in hybrid habitats. Every session unfolds a new narrative.

Now it is your turn. Step into this adventure and let your imagination take flight among the stars.


## 2. Game Overview

### 2.1 Player Mode

- **Single-player**: the user assumes the role of a space habitat engineer.  
- Emphasis on individual creativity, strategy, and decision-making.  
- Every session presents a unique challenge, promoting iterative improvement and optimization.

### 2.2 Core Components

The game is divided into two main sections:

1. **Habitat Types** – architectural structures and their operational characteristics.  
2. **Item and Mission Impact Analysis** – functional evaluation of systems, crew support, and operational efficiency.


## 3. Part 1: Habitat Types

### 3.1 Cylindrical Metallic Habitat

**Reference:** Harmony Module, ISS  
**Description:** Rigid aluminum cylinder launched pre-pressurized with integrated systems.  

**Advantages:**

- Structurally robust for mounting external systems.  
- Ready-to-use, reducing setup time for crew.  

**Disadvantages:**

- Launch efficiency limited (1:1 volume ratio).  
- High cost for smaller rockets.  

**Typical Mission Profile:**

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Location  | Low Earth Orbit or cislunar stations |
| Duration  | 6 months to multiple years |
| Crew      | 2–4 astronauts per module |


### 3.2 Hybrid “Canister” Habitat

**Reference:** Artemis Surface Habitat  
**Description:** Combines a rigid metallic base with an inflatable multi-level upper section to maximize volume.  

**Advantages:**

- Maximized internal volume.  
- Stable base suitable for planetary surfaces.  

**Disadvantages:**

- Deployment complexity: requires inflation and outfitting.  

**Typical Mission Profile:**

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Location  | Lunar or Martian surface |
| Duration  | 30–60+ days |
| Crew      | 2–4 astronauts |


### 3.3 Expandable Capsule Habitat

**Reference:** BEAM (Bigelow Expandable Activity Module)  
**Description:** Launched compact and inflated in space. Multi-layer construction ensures protection against vacuum, radiation, and micrometeoroids.  

**Advantages:**

- High launch-to-habitable volume ratio.  
- Lightweight and flexible.  

**Disadvantages:**

- External equipment installation is challenging.  
- Material may degrade over long durations.  

**Typical Mission Profile:**

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Location  | Expansion modules or Mars transit/surface habitats |
| Duration  | Variable (depending on material resilience) |
| Crew      | 2–6 astronauts |


## 4. Part 2: Habitat Items and Mission Impact

Each system influences **crew safety, operational efficiency, and mission success**.

### 4.1 EVA Support

| Item | Function | Operational Impact |
|------|---------|------------------|
| EVA Zone (Airlock, Suitports) | Safe transition between habitat and vacuum | 1–2 units: basic EVA; multiple: redundancy; none: confined |
| EVA Computer Station | EVA planning and monitoring | One: functional baseline; Two: simultaneous management |

### 4.2 Crew Health and Well-being

| Item | Function | Operational Impact |
|------|---------|------------------|
| Exercise Equipment | Prevents muscle/bone loss | Single: minimum; Two or more: redundancy |
| Hygiene Area & Waste Management | Maintains hygiene, health, morale | One: basic; Two: enhanced comfort for 4+ crew |
| Medical Area | Diagnostics, treatments, emergencies | Dedicated: essential; Multiuse: acceptable for short missions |

### 4.3 Habitability and Daily Life

| Item | Function | Operational Impact |
|------|---------|------------------|
| Sleeping Quarters | Privacy, ventilation, acoustic isolation | Shared: <30 days; Private: >30 days |
| Galley & Wardroom | Meals, social interaction | One combined area: ideal; multiple: reduces cohesion |

### 4.4 Operations and Work

| Item | Function | Operational Impact |
|------|---------|------------------|
| Computer Stations & Control Panels | Habitat operations | One: single point of failure; multiple: redundancy |
| Research Lab & ISPR Racks | Scientific experiments | Multiuse: functional; dedicated: maximizes output |
| Environmental Control & Life Support (ECLSS) | Air, water, temperature regulation | Open-loop: short missions; Regenerative: essential for long missions |


## 5. Structural Components

| Item | Function | Operational Impact |
|------|---------|------------------|
| Walls (Fixed or Retractable) | Define functional zones, airflow management | Few: open concept; Fixed: essential >30 days; Retractable: flexible reconfiguration |
| Storage Cabinets & ISPR Racks | Logistics and payload management | Few: disorganized; Multiple: efficient and scalable |
